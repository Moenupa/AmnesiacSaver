## Motivation

Blackboard learn is considered a great web study platform, but sometimes its information is so detailed that students may miss important events. In addition, blackboard monitors flooded messages of all courses, important notification is not sufficiently emphasized for forgetful guys like one of the developers.

Thus, to prevent forgetful guys from missing their quizzes, DDLs, and other important events, we decided to develop Amnesiac Savior in aid of recording important events.
